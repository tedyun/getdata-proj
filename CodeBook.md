## Introduction

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc_XYZ and tGyro_XYZ. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc_XYZ and tGravityAcc_XYZ) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk_XYZ and tBodyGyroJerk_XYZ). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc_XYZ, fBodyAccJerk_XYZ, fBodyGyro_XYZ, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
'_XYZ' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

## Variables

"subject"
- The subject (numbers from 1 to 30)

"activity"
- The activity that the subject conducted: "WALKING", "WALKING_UPSTAIRS", "WALKING_DOWNSTAIRS", "SITTING", "STANDING", or "LAYING"

For the remaining 66 variables, use the following dictionary:
- 't': time
- 'f': frequency domain signals

- 'std: standard deviation
- 'Acc': acceleration
- 'Gyro': gyroscope 3-axial raw signal
- 'X': x-axis
- 'Y': y-axis
- 'Z': z-axis
- 'Body': body
- 'Gravity': gravity
- 'Jerk': Jerk signals
- 'Mag': magnitude

Units:
- 't': second
- 'f': hertz
